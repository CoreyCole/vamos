# q-milestone-create-tickets

Draft ticket bodies, obtain approval for each required ticket, create only approved tickets, and update durable routing/status artifacts.

## Hermes completion

After durable work and verification, end with a normal final response that names the durable artifact and the smallest decision for Hermes or the lead. In a managed opaque-settlement run, do not call `vamos hermes pi done`, emit semantic `outcome`/`next` YAML, or launch a successor; `pi done` is an explicit operator recovery command only.


## Durable boundaries

Use `thoughts/...`-relative artifact references. The filesystem and plan-owned `.vamos/sessions/{pi,hermes}` artifacts are durable truth; database indexes are rebuildable. Do not expose credentials, gateway URLs, process IDs, or manager diagnostics in plan artifacts.
